Describe what you want to do, including:
1. what inputs you will provide, if any:

NOTE:

1. Only general answers are provided.
   If you want to ask about "why X did not work", please use the

2. About how to implement new models / new dataloader / new training logic, etc., check documentation first.

3. We do not answer general machine learning / computer vision questions that are not specific to DETR, such as how a model works, how to improve your training/make it converge, or what algorithm/methods can be used to achieve X.
